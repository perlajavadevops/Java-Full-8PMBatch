1.java.io package
2.Streams?
3. 2 types: Character streams and Binary Streams
ex: "Confience" --> bytes[] --> file 'Confience' --InputStream and OutStream

FileWriter and FileReader
abc --> abc

4. FileInputStream --> and FileOutStream
5. BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutStream
ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutStream -->Serialization (java.io

6. File-->

System.out.println --> printstream -->PrintWriter

Servlets

7. IOException-->compiletime exception or checked exception

escape sequence charaters


8. Serialization is nothing converting java object to binary object
9. De-Serialization is nothg con binry to java object.

reading/writing --> from java? IOStreams -- Input/Output Stream. 
Stream? -- Source and Destination?

writing into file
java --> file
source    destination

reading data from file
file --> java
source	destination

===============
streams are 2 tpe

binary stream(
reading and writing the binary
1. FileInputStream
2. FileOutputStream
2
character streams

FileWriter and FileReader
================
serializatoin? Converting java object into binary streams. what is the

Serializable? empty interface(marker interface)

1(ATM netwrok) --> 1(Bank (hack data)

De-Serialization -->converting binary streams object into java object


Student impelnt servialbe







Serialization:

converting java object to binary stream object will called as serialization
converting binary stream object to java object  will called as de-serialization

Serializable -- network
