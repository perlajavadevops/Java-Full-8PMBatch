What is Object? An object will exist either logically or pysically
OOPS: Object Oriented Progrm System. --> everthing will be maintained as object in the prog lan.
	Java, Python, .Net. Scala, Rube, Object C++....

EX: Human, Cat, Chair, Eclipse, Browsers....


they are 6 features are there in the OOPS: 

1. Object, 2. Class, 3. Inheritance, 4. Encapsulation, 5. Abstraction, 6. Polymorpshim.
 Object? An object will exist either logically or pysically. In java logically object
 
 Object is containing 3 main features(Charactersitcs) : 1. Identity, 2. State (Properites), 3. Beheviour.
 Human: 2 hands, legs, eyes, ears, nose.....
 Student: id, name, subject... 
 
 Address: house no. street no or name, pincode, state, country.....
 Beheviour: (actions) 
 
 Dhatrika Sai --->
 
 Class: blue print or template which contains.. data, contructors, methods..... blocks.. inner class...
 
 Inheritance: 
 
 Tata Cars: 
 
 Car -> TataMotors --> Nexon 
 
 Encapsulation: 
 Abstraction: 
Procedure oriented pro: C, C++


naming conventions:

class: noun
variables: alwsys small leters
methods: lower case and in --> getDetails(), displayDetails()
interface
constants:
inn

what is method? : methods means function and it will expose the behiviour an object.

they are 2 types: static method and instance method


Static Method:

static keyword and we can call static methods by using classname.stati emthod Student.getPerca()

Instance Method: the method defined without static keyword we can instance mehtod or non-static method.
non-static methods should call by using an object.

what is an object? and tell some of the objects. and create one exaple lke student
2. What is method and how to create?
3. Explain about oops?

How to create an object in java?

1. using new keyword
2. using clone method
3. newInstance()


Constructor:
What is constructor: constr means it is special mehtod in java and it will be used to create an objec and provide values for instance memeber 

2 types of constructors:
1. No parameter constructor or default const
2. Parameterized constroctur

Default Construcor: the purpose default cons is to provide defaults values for an object state (properties)
this default con will generated by java compiler only if there is no constructor defination in the class.

can we create more 1 than construcor? Yes.
Constructor overloading: more readable. 


Data types casting: 

long and float we need to specify the safix.

10L or 10l and 10.90F or 10.90f

What is constructor chaining? 
means one cons can call another con and so on.. will called as contro chaining


what is method? It is kind of function and will expose the behivour of an object
2. Static mehtods, 2. Non-static method or instance method.

What is Method Overloading? 

Method Overloading can be defined within the same class but method name shoud be same.
Adv? more readable. 
How Achive? 
1. Having no of aruguments in the method defination
2. by changing the data types of your parameters of method.

By changing the return type of mehtod is not possible. it will give the compile time.
Method overloaing can be achived by static emthods and instance methods.

1. by default java compiler will consider as integer (int ) if any values which like 1, 2, 3, 1000, 5990, 

1. by default java compiler will consider as double if any values which like 10.89, 2.90, 3.70, 1000.70, 5990.90, 
If you have more than 1 constro in the class we will called as Construcotr Overloading.
Construcotr Overloading: 1. No Parameters... 2. by changing the data type of your parater.


Create Student class and create multiple constrocts with differenct paratmers?
Create a class with default constroctrs exectue it..

Operator Overloading: (-,+, *, %, ==)
+:

10+10 ==> addition 20
20+20==> 40

"abc"+"def" ==>abcdef --> + operator will act as concatation
'a'+'c' ==> 97+99==> 

90+'c' ==> 

90+"Gangadhar" ==> con

"Gangadhar"+90+90 ==> con


90+90"Gangadhar" ==> con


this keyword:

it will refer current class object or instance

this keyword is used for only instance memebers( instance variables, non static methods, instnace block) of current class. we can not use this keyword for static memebers(static variables, static methods, static block).

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError
Exception in thread "main" JVMOutofMemeory
ClasNotFoundException


Inheritance: 

Single inheritance
multi level inher
multiple inher
hieracle inher
hybrid inher

extends, implements

what is adv inher? code reusabilityu


Method Overriding?

Parent class will have method.

child class will be trying to override same method which is already present in the parent class
1. method name should same.
2. mehtod paramenters also should be same
3. method return type is should same.. 

Is java lang pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?
