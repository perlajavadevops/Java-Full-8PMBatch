arrays means... collection of similar type of data which we called as arrays.

int[] numbers = 1,2,3,4,5 0 

10.11

arrays will start from 0 index.

arrays size fixed.

length arrays propert 

arrays will allow to maintain duplicates..

initialize values: 

in signle 

int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,0};//delcaration+initialization
				//1-0, 2-1, 3,-2 ,4-3, 5-4, 0-5
int[] numbers_arra = new int[2];//declarting

numbers_arra[0] = 89;
numbers_arra[0] = 89;
numbers_arra[0] = 89;
numbers_arra[0] = 89;

will get ArrayIndexofBoundsException ---> runtime exception.
